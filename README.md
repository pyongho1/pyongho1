### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer that is interested developing software especially in Javascript, Node, and Typescript. I am excited by the opportunity to create something impactful and meaningful through coding, and my experience as a cafe manager has given me the ability to work effectively in a team environment. The more I learn, the more I am eager to see what I will be able to create next.
